<h1>Procedurall terrain generation in unity</h1>
<ul>
  <li>right now I don't know what are future aspirations for this project</li> 
  <li>you can find there not fully done procedurall terrain generation tool implemented in Unity</li>
  <li>for fast generating of noisemaps, I decided to use (for the first time) computeshaders</li>
  <li>If you want to use it right now, try to look into the SampleScene, where it's kind of demonstrated</li>
</ul>
